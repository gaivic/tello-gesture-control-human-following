# Tello Gesture Control & Human Following

## Introduction

Welcome to the Tello Gesture Control & Human Following project! This repository integrates the tello, OpenCV, and MediaPipe technologies to achieve automatic tracking of specific individuals and gesture-based control for Tello drones.

## Features

- **Automatic Human Following:** Utilize the capabilities of MediaPipe for real-time human detection and tracking, enabling the drone to autonomously follow a specific person.

- **Gesture Control:** Implement gesture recognition using MediaPipe to allow users to interact with the drone through predefined hand gestures, providing an intuitive and hands-free control experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Tello drone
- Python 3

### File explanation

1. Action_Detection_video.py:
   - gesture estimation using mediapipe, the result will be each frame's gesture
   - return the important value for human-following function, included shoulder distance and human center

2. main_test_integrate.py:
   - control the takeoff and land of tello
   - find human automatically
   - follow human
   - use the gesture result to make corresponding flight control

3. model515.h5:
  - model for gesture detection

## Usage

- Ensure that the Tello drone is connected to the computer using wi-fi, and the necessary setup is complete.

- ensure that you have install all package that will use in the file

- Execute the main_test_integrate.py script, which initiates the automatic human following and gesture control functionalities.

- Interact with the drone using predefined hand gestures, and observe its response.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements, bug fixes, or new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments

- The project builds upon the capabilities of PX4, Raspberry Pi, DroneKit, and MediaPipe. Special thanks to their respective communities.

- Inspiration for this project came from the increasing applications of drones and the desire to enhance their capabilities for interactive and autonomous operations.
